The CldImage component provides an easy way to deliver images from Cloudinary with the same experience you'd expect inside of a Nuxt app. With it comes access to more advanced features like dynamic cropping, background removal, overlays, and other Cloudinary transformations.

Under the hood, this CldImage uses [Unpic](https://unpic.pics/) for delivering optimized images. Check out the documentation of Unpic for all available props and options like priority, loading, sizes, and more!

## Basic Usage

The basic required props include `width`, `height`, `src`, and `alt`:

:cld-image{src="images/sneakers" width="400" height="400" alt="test" style="text-align: center; margin: 0 auto"}

```vue
<template>
  <CldImage
    src="cld-sample-5"
    width="400"
    height="400"
    alt="My Awesome Image"
  />
</template>
```

Thanks to the auto import feature of Nuxt, you do not need to import anything. Just add `<CldImage />` to your template and optimize your images!

The `src` property takes in a Cloudinary Public ID which includes the folder path along with the ID of the image itself. The `width` and the `height` should represent the rendered size and the `alt` value should be a text-based description of the image. The `sizes` prop is optional, but recommended for Responsive Sizing.

## Transformations

Using `CldImage.vue` component is really straight forward. It accepts the same attributes as native img tag (such us `sizes`, `width`, `loading`, etc) but also a bunch of Cloudinary specific props used to optimize/transform the image (such as `removeBackground`, `overlays`, `gravity`, etc):

:image-with-overlays{style="text-align: center; margin: 0 auto"}

```html
<CldImage
  width="987"
  height="987"
  src="images/woman-headphones"
  sizes="50vw"
  crop="thumb"
  gravity="faces"
  removeBackground
  tint="40:253f8c"
  :underlay="'images/city-skyline'"
  :overlays="[
    {
      position: {
        gravity: 'north',
        y: 60
      },
      text: {
        color: 'rgb:52a4ff80',
        fontFamily: 'Source Sans Pro',
        fontSize: 320,
        fontWeight: 'black',
        text: 'MUSIC',
        letterSpacing: -10,
        lineSpacing: -100,
        stroke: true,
        border: '20px_solid_rgb:2d0eff99',
      }
    },
    {
      position: {
        gravity: 'south',
        y: 60
      },
      text: {
        color: 'rgb:52a4ff80',
        fontFamily: 'Source Sans Pro',
        fontSize: 320,
        fontWeight: 'black',
        text: 'IS LIFE',
        letterSpacing: -10,
        lineSpacing: -100,
        stroke: true,
        border: '20px_solid_rgb:2d0eff99',
      }
    }
  ]"
/>
```

## Using Cloudinary URL's

CldImage supports passing a fully qualified Cloudinary URL as the src, however, it must include a version number (/v1234) in order to be correctly parsed.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
The version number is required due to the variable nature of Cloudinary URLs. This helps to ensure the integretiy when during the parsing process.

```vue
<template>
  <CldImage
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/v1234/cld-sample-5"
    width="400"
    height="400"
    alt="My Awesome Image"
  />
</template>
```
